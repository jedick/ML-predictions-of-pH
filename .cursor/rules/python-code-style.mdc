# Python Code Style

## Black Code Formatter

All Python code in this project must follow the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) code style.

### Rules

1. **Always format Python code with Black** before committing
2. Use Black's default settings (line length: 88 characters)
3. Run `black <file>` or `black .` to format files
4. Ensure all Python files are formatted consistently

### Usage

```bash
# Format a specific file
black predict_ph.py

# Format all Python files in the project
black .

# Check formatting without making changes
black --check .
```

### Integration

- Black should be run as part of the development workflow
- Consider adding a pre-commit hook to automatically format code
- All new Python code should be written to conform to Black's style

### Benefits

- Consistent code formatting across the project
- Reduced style debates in code reviews
- Automatic formatting reduces manual formatting work
- Improved code readability
