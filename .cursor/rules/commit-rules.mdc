# Commit Message Guidelines

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

## Commit Message Structure
```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Allowed Types
- `feat` – New feature
- `fix` – Bug fix
- `docs` – Documentation changes only
- `style` – Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.) without affecting logic
- `refactor` – Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf` – Performance improvements
- `test` – Adding or modifying tests
- `build` – Changes to build system or dependencies
- `ci` – Continuous integration configuration changes
- `chore` – Maintenance tasks (no production code changes)
- `revert` – Revert a previous commit

## Commit Rules
- Type is required and must be lowercase
- Scope is optional but recommended for clarity (e.g., `feat(ml): add Random Forest model`)
- Short description should be max ~50 characters, written in imperative mood, no period at the end
- Body (optional) explains what and why, wrapped at ~72 characters per line
- Footer (optional) used for breaking changes or issue references
