# ML Predictions of pH

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting pH from microbial abundances and 16S rRNA gene sequences. The approach incorporates both traditional machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forests and KNN regression) and deep learning techniques, with particular emphasis on language models for predictions from gene sequences.

## Methods

- **Traditional ML**: Random Forests, KNN regression, and other classical approaches
- **Deep Learning**: Language models and other neural network architectures, especially for gene sequence-based predictions

## Project History

_Notable changes to architecture, data, features, or results will be documented here._
